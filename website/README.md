# megaphone.kuber.studio

Static landing page for Megaphone. No build step or runtime dependencies are required; serve this directory as the web root.

## Local preview

```bash
python3 -m http.server 4173 --directory website
```

Then open `http://localhost:4173`.

## Design notes

- The first viewport is a generated waveform field with Megaphone's real recording overlay and no oversized app artwork. It does not depend on video or GIF playback.
- The hero leads with private, on-device operation and states the macOS 26 / Apple silicon requirement beneath the download action.
- The fixed navigation uses a standalone liquid-glass renderer: generated canvas displacement/specular maps feed SVG backdrop filters for the bar, active lens, GitHub control, and download control. The lens supports press, drag, overshoot, and snap interactions without changing itself as the page scrolls.
- The feature bento demonstrates a paced, auto-scrolling Smart Cleanup stream, a three-row locale wall sourced from `SpeechTranscriber.supportedLocales`, and paired macOS-style Dictionary and Memory windows. The Dictionary demo supports adding, editing, and deleting words. The locale illustration currently reflects the 30 downloadable locales reported by the target Mac. Detailed Mail and Slack scenes alternate automatically to demonstrate active-window context, while the Hey Megaphone response appears only after its section crosses the scroll threshold.
- The compact recording surface follows `RecordingOverlay.swift`: a translucent 92-point surface with a centered nine-bar waveform. In the hero, those bars and the background field share one animation clock. The agent demo advances through Claude Code, Codex, and Cursor based on scroll progress.
- The terminal switcher is adapted from interaction patterns in [brainless](https://github.com/theswerd/brainless), used under its MIT license (Copyright © 2026 Ben Swerdlow). No source code was copied from glasscn-components; it was used as visual research only because its repository does not currently include a license.
- Animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and all core content works without JavaScript.

## Deploy

Serve `website/` at `https://megaphone.kuber.studio/`. The canonical URL, sitemap, structured data, and download links already target that domain.

GitHub Pages builds a temporary `_site` directory and hydrates release placeholders from GitHub's latest stable release. The current version, publication date, DMG URL, release URL, structured data, and release-note demo therefore update automatically whenever the site deploys after a new release.
